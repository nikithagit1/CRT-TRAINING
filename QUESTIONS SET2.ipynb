    "# Logical Question 1\n",
    "# Write a Python program to check whether a given integer is positive, negative, or zero using if-elif-else statements.\n",
    "# Hint: Use the 'if', 'elif', and 'else' structure to compare the integer with zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 2\n",
    "# Write a program to determine if a number is even or odd.\n",
    "# Hint: Use the modulo operator (%) to check divisibility by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 3\n",
    "# Create a program to find the largest of three integers entered by the user.\n",
    "# Hint: Use nested if-else statements or multiple if-elif conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 4\n",
    "# Write a program that checks if a year is a leap year.\n",
    "# Hint: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 5\n",
    "# Develop a Python program to calculate the grade based on marks entered by the user.\n",
    "# Hint: Use if-elif-else to define ranges for grades (e.g., A, B, C, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 6\n",
    "# Write a Python program to display numbers from 1 to 10 using a while loop.\n",
    "# Hint: Initialize a variable and increment it inside the loop until it reaches 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 7\n",
    "# Create a program to find the factorial of a number using a while loop.\n",
    "# Hint: Multiply numbers from the given number down to 1 inside the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 8\n",
    "# Write a Python program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 50 using a while loop.\n",
    "# Hint: Use a condition to check if the number is even before printing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 9\n",
    "# Develop a program to calculate the sum of all integers between 1 and a number entered by the user using a while loop.\n",
    "# Hint: Use a loop to add numbers incrementally.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 10\n",
    "# Write a program to reverse a given number using a while loop.\n",
    "# Hint: Use modulus and integer division to extract digits and rebuild the number in reverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 11\n",
    "# Create a program to check whether a number is a palindrome or not using a while loop.\n",
    "# Hint: Reverse the number and compare it with the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 12\n",
    "# Write a program to count the number of digits in a given integer using a while loop.\n",
    "# Hint: Use integer division repeatedly to remove the last digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 13\n",
    "# Develop a Python program to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using a while loop.\n",
    "# Hint: Use the Euclidean algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 14\n",
    "# Create a program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms using a while loop.\n",
    "# Hint: Start with 0 and 1, then add the last two numbers in the sequence repeatedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Logical Question 15\n",
    "# Write a Python program to find whether a number is prime or not using a while loop.\n",
    "# Hint: A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself; check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number.\n",
